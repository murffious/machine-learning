How is Amazon like the Roman Empire of old if so...?



I. Tech and Govt' Policy predictions 
Wild West and Trains- Telegraph Banks Robbers, IDEAS and Enginenering and Weapons books
Laws 
Tech to pass them 

II. Patterns of Rise and Fall (amazon is not falling lol) just seeking a possible correlation
Rome
Precursor:grew from a small town
The man: 
The Bubble: 
Results Legacy: world today stands on shoulders of Ancient Rome

Amazon
Precursor: The 1993  browsers released for access to the World Wide Web and rise in personal home computer ownership, popularizing use of the Internet.
The man: Bezos left the job he had on Wall Street and went to start Amazon in 1994 feeling it was late to the party of the dotcom biz boom. Maybe late is good.
The Bubble: Between 1995 and 2000, peaking in 2000 then the bubble popped. 
Results Legacy : AWS - developers/businesses stand on the shoulders of all that is great for seemingly years to come
