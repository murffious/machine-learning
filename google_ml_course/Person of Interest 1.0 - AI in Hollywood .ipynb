    "\n",
    "Design a Recommend System that outputs a SSN to the user group. The input comes from anything the machine can gather from what is online aka a digital footprint from video, voice(phone etc), GPS tracking, purchases, emails, social media etc. One TV show that made this system/idea a common pop culture use for AI in the media is called Person of Interset. What is fascinating is that over the 5 seasons each episode displays with some elegance the use of AI to make decisions of life or death. Its pitfalls and strengths in lots of ways I think are realistically portrayed. This show fascinated me and is stil one of the only TV shows I have ever watched and loved. \n",

    "I am creating a series of projects based on \"AI in Hollywood.\" Its almost like a myth busters but for AI specifically. I want to prove the reality or each possible use of AI. I am 100% doing this to practice ML in a personally meanigful and practical way and have no agenda otherwise. A reference to the show for this edition of my series can be seen by clicking the link here [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/].\n",
